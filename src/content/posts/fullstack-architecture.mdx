## 🧠 Introduction

In the last few years, I’ve worked on everything from IPTV streaming platforms to SaaS dashboards and e-commerce stores. Each project came with its own set of technical and business challenges — and that’s exactly why I love building software.

This post is a behind-the-scenes look at how I approach full-stack development — from backend architecture to frontend frameworks, deployment pipelines, and performance tuning.

## ⚙️ Starting with the Right Stack

Choosing the right tech stack is about more than trends — it’s about tradeoffs.

For example:

- **Java + Spring Boot / Micronaut** gives me performance and structure for complex microservices.
- **React or Astro** on the frontend gives flexibility, while **Next.js** handles SEO and dynamic rendering.
- **MongoDB** for flexible document storage, and **PostgreSQL** for relational data needs.
- **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Portainer** let me control deployment environments from local dev to cloud.

I also integrate CI/CD from day one using **GitLab CI**, **GitHub Actions**, or **CircleCI** to automate testing and deployment.

## 📺 Real Case: Building an IPTV Platform

For [flixteam.tv](https://flixteam.tv), I led development of an IPTV platform that:

- Streams live and on-demand content to web and mobile
- Handles Stripe and **crypto payments**
- Includes an admin dashboard for content and user management

### Key tools used:

- **Micronaut v4** backend for native-image speed and low memory usage
- **Astro + React** for fast, SEO-friendly frontend
- **React Native** for mobile clients
- **MongoDB + PostgreSQL** for hybrid data modeling
- **Vercel** and GCP for deployment

The result? A modern, performant, and reliable system that users enjoy — and one we can scale confidently.

## 💳 Performance + Payments

In another project — [bigrig.app](https://bigrig.app) — I migrated the backend from **Micronaut v2 to v4**, improving cold start times dramatically. I also optimized MongoDB queries and integrated a secure Stripe-based billing system.

Every tech choice was guided by one question: _“Will this scale and stay maintainable six months from now?”_

## 🚀 What I’ve Learned

- **Architect for growth** — even MVPs should be modular and easy to evolve
- **Build pipelines early** — CI/CD isn’t a nice-to-have, it’s a must
- **Measure before you optimize** — logs, profiling, and analytics always come first
- **Code reviews are mentorship moments** — I grow the team as much as I grow the code

## ✍️ Final Thoughts

Engineering is not just about writing code — it's about understanding people, business, and long-term impact.

If you're building something and need a strong backend, full-stack architecture, or just someone who can ship — let’s talk.
