## üß≠ Overview

**BigRig** is a logistics and transportation management platform built for trucking businesses to manage routes, client operations, payment flows, and team logistics. As the system grew in complexity and usage, the platform required a full-stack overhaul and performance upgrade to scale efficiently.

---

## üë®‚Äçüíª Role

**Full Stack Developer**, **Solution Architect**, and **DevOps Contributor**

---

## ‚ùì Problem

- The platform's performance and cold-start latency were increasingly problematic due to limitations in the older **Micronaut v2** backend.
- The UI needed modernization for better user engagement and onboarding experience.
- Stripe payments and Firebase auth integrations were partially working but not reliable under load.

---

## üéØ Goal

1. Upgrade backend from **Micronaut v2 to v4** to benefit from performance improvements and native image support.
2. Refactor the frontend with **Next.js** and **TypeScript** for improved maintainability and speed.
3. Implement a stable and secure **payment** and **auth** flow using **Stripe** and **Firebase**.
4. Optimize **MongoDB queries** to reduce latency and improve overall app responsiveness.

---

## ‚ú® Solution

### üîß Tech Architecture

- **Backend:** Java + Micronaut v4 (native-image enabled), deployed on GCP with containerization.
- **Frontend:** Next.js with React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript for clean and responsive UIs.
- **Database:** MongoDB with improved indexing and optimized queries for truck/route data.
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth with role-based access control.
- **Payments:** Stripe integration for secure driver/client billing and subscription management.
- **DevOps:** Deployment via GCP Cloud Run and Firebase Hosting with CI/CD support.

---

### üíª Frontend Experience

- Designed a modern and minimal dashboard UI with responsive components for route tracking and operations management.
- Integrated dynamic dashboards with data pulled from the Micronaut API layer.
- Stripe billing flows and payment history implemented with real-time updates using Firebase.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend & Performance

- Migrated the core backend from Micronaut v2 to v4.
- Refactored legacy logic into modular microservices with improved performance and scalability.
- Reduced cold start time and improved container boot-up using native image builds.
- Enhanced MongoDB indexes and rewrote key queries to optimize throughput and reduce response times by 60%.

---

## üöß Challenges and Learnings

1. **Micronaut v2 ‚Üí v4 migration:** Required deep refactoring to support updated annotations, DI flow, and native compilation.
2. **Stripe complexity:** Handling edge cases like failed payments, retries, and webhook validation.
3. **MongoDB tuning:** Real-world usage helped identify slow queries, which were fixed with custom indexing strategies and aggregation pipelines.

---

## ‚ú® Final Thoughts

- This project was a full-stack challenge that required balancing architecture, performance, and usability.
- Migrating to Micronaut v4 with native image support made the backend *much* more efficient, especially for cloud deployments.
- With Next.js + Firebase on the frontend and solid backend infrastructure, BigRig is now ready to scale confidently.
